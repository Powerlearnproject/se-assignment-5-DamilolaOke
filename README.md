9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Here's how to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code:
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up for your programming language (e.g., Node.js for Javascript).
Create a new file (e.g., main.py for Python) and write your program code.

Launch Configuration (Optional but Recommended):
While VS Code can attempt to debug your program directly, creating a launch configuration file provides more control and customization.
Open the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
Click the cogwheel icon next to the run button and select "Add Configuration...".
Choose a template based on your programming language. VS Code will generate a default launch.json file in your project's .vscode folder.
You can customize this file to specify program arguments, working directory, and other debugging options.

Set Breakpoints:
Click on the line number where you want the program to pause during execution. A red dot will appear indicating the breakpoint.
You can set multiple breakpoints throughout your code.

Start Debugging:
Click the green "Run and Debug" button (or press F5).
VS Code will launch your program and pause at the first breakpoint.

Debug Controls:
Once paused at a breakpoint, you can use various controls in the Run and Debug view:
Step Over (F10): Executes the current line and moves to the next line.
Step Into (F11): Steps into function calls, pausing at the first line of the called function.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Steps out of the current function, continuing execution until the next breakpoint.
Continue (F5): Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.
The Variables view shows the values of variables in your program at the current breakpoint.
The Call Stack view displays the function call hierarchy, allowing you to navigate through the program's execution flow.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specific condition is met.
Data Breakpoints: Pause execution when a variable's value changes.
Watches: Monitor the value of specific variables throughout the program's execution.
Console: Interact with your program by sending input directly from the VS Code console.
Source Control Integration: Step through code history to identify code changes that introduced bugs.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
VS Code offers tight integration with Git for seamless version control. Here's how you can leverage it:

1. Initializing a Git Repository:
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Go to the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G).
If Git isn't detected, you'll see an "Initialize Repository" button. Click it to create a new Git repository within your project folder.
This is equivalent to running git init in the command line.

2. Making Commits:
Once you've made changes to your code, VS Code highlights them in the Source Control view.
Stage specific changes for the next commit using the "+" icon next to the file or using the Stage Changes option. Staging means marking those changes to be included in the commit.
You can also stage all changes using the double checkmark icon ("Stage All").
Click on the Commit button (check mark icon) in the Source Control view.
Enter a descriptive commit message summarizing your code changes.
A good commit message should be concise and informative, explaining what was changed and why.
Click the checkmark again or press Ctrl+Enter to commit your staged changes.

3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Make sure you have a GitHub account and a remote repository created for your project.
In VS Code, go to the Source Control view.
Click on the "..." menu (three dots) and select "Publish to GitHub".
If it's your first time connecting, VS Code will prompt you to sign in to your GitHub account.
Follow the on-screen instructions to link your local repository with your remote GitHub repository (URL).
This is similar to running git remote add origin <URL> and git push -u origin <branch_name> commands in the terminal.
Once linked, you'll see your remote repository listed in the Source Control view.
Now, when you make and commit changes, you can push them to your remote GitHub repository using the "Push" button (upwards arrow icon) in the Source Control view.
Additional Tips:

VS Code allows creating and switching between branches directly within the interface.
Utilize the built-in Git features like viewing commit history, inspecting file changes, and reverting to previous versions.
Refer to the VS Code documentation for a comprehensive guide on using Git with VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview.
